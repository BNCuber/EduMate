EduMate -  Educational  Assistant 

Team: Brandon Nguyen, Seojin  Kim, Kushal Bhattarai

Proposal: We are aiming to design an app to offer an educational experience for students in anatomy, geography, and Java. The app will present the user with a layout of a certain structure of the subject at hand. For example, the user will be presented with the human body to view anatomy. Individual organs and body parts will be able to be selected and information will be displayed. Then that information can be added to a flashcard to be further studied.

Architecture: We will utilize a style sheet to give the app a better look. Individual parts consist of touchable highlight components(or some related component) for user interaction and information access. The flashcards will be stored in a state array to be accessed when studying. The app will feature a navbar to move between subjects (anatomy, geography, and Java). The first page that a user will interact with will be a homepage that can be used to change between different study sets.
